For this project we had the goal of creating a system that asks for various inputs from the "astronauts" as they make a trip to mars. The goal of the system is to collect the most data from mars with a limited fuel supply. The system would ask the "astronauts" to select with fuel canister would power which components of the ship. When a canister would run out of fuel it would ask the crew to select a new canister to connect the equipment to.
