For this project, we had the goal of creating a system that asks for various inputs from the "astronauts" as they make a trip to Mars. The system would ask the "astronauts" to select which fuel canister would power certain components onboard spacecraft. When a canister would run out of fuel it would ask the crew to select a new canister to connect the equipment to. The purpose of this trip is to collect the most data from mars as possible with a limited fuel supply and still return to earth safely. This system also informed the "astronauts" when their fuel supply was running low. Another key feature was that it would inform the "astronauts" when they would have to leave mars to ensure they would have enough fuel to return to earth safely.
