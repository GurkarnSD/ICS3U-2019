This was a project that was assigned as our final culminating task. 
The project was to replicate an existing strategy game and implement a sort of "AI" or computer player that would go up against a real player.
I coded this text-based version of Connect 4 and implemented a computer player that blocks that player's attempts at winning and understands win it has an opportunity to win itself.
